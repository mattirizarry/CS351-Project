Hey everyone! Let‚Äôs try and meet around 9 tomorrow morning!
I have made pretty significant progress
Afterward, I‚Äôll schedule some time individually with each of you so I can help you through one of the tasks
OliPheoPhas ‚Äî 04/25/2023 7:28 AM

Leemb ‚Äî 04/25/2023 9:01 AM
That works for me! I get home from class around 3:30, possibly a little earlier, and I have a work meeting over Zoom at 5. Otherwise I'm free!
OliPheoPhas ‚Äî 04/25/2023 9:02 AM
Any time after 12:30pm. And I got a thing between 3:30 and 4:30 where I‚Äôll be unavailable

anyone wanna hop on a call and pair program through the authentication I just added?
authentication seems so difficult but it is really easy
i added it primitively with only a few lines
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 10:30 AM
I'm about to make some breakfast and then work on the report, if you're still working on it then I'm down to join!
Inverse ‚Äî Today at 10:42 AM
fire up a call whenever!
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 11:53 AM
finally free, got roped into a few other things
Leemb

Inverse ‚Äî Today at 5:33 PM
you think shell take that?

Leemb ‚Äî Today at 5:37 PM
i think she might be looking for a list of representatives that also shows those stats for each
for the report i mean
did you mean for the report or just for a user index page? bc it looks great imo
Inverse ‚Äî Today at 5:40 PM
for the report since it has all the necessary information there
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 5:44 PM
i just sent an alumni friend the prompt to see what he thought, he thinks she's looking for a list of reps and their data as well
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 7:13 PM
taking a quick break from the report to rehash the readme to fit what she wants, do we have a rough idea of the system requirements of the code? 
i think probably just saying a web client and X amount of ram are good enough
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 7:48 PM
@Inverse I think I can have this document mostly complete in about an hour, would you want to meet in a call afterwards for finishing touches? I have a folder ready to zip, I just need to finish this and include the latest code
If you're still working on some of the code, no worries!
Inverse ‚Äî Today at 7:48 PM
Yeah i would be down to meet in a bit
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 7:49 PM
Sounds good!
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 8:51 PM
Wanna shoot for 9:30?
Leemb ‚Äî Today at 9:32 PM
I'm ready for a call whenever!

# CS351 Project Application - Spring 2023

## Authors

Connor McElroy ‚Äì connor.mcelroy054@topper.wku.edu

## System Requirements

The requirements for this application to be run are:
- <1GB RAM
- Internet Access
- Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)


## Running the Application

The current iteration of the application can be viewed at: https://cs-351-project-1m8fkmzr1-mattirizarry.vercel.app/

To use this iteration, you can login with the following:
User Num: 75
Password: password


## Local environment setup

Since the application is web-based, it is designed to be accessed from a web browser. However, if you would like to run the application on a local machine with a local database, please use the following steps.

#### 1. Setup PostgreSQL

The application requires PostgreSQL to be installed alongside the server. As such, you will need to install PostgreSQL.
For Debian-based Linux, you can run the following:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

For Windows, you can download the latest ProstgreSQL installer here: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads

#### 2. Setup NPM

If you do not already have NPM installed, you will need to install it.
Unix based systems should take advantage of a package called nvm to manage versions of Node.js: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
Windows systems should follow this guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows

Once you have installed these packages, you can verify that they are installed on your system with:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `source_code` directory, or copy/move it to where it is desired and navigate to it. Then run, `npm install`. This will install all necessary packages on your system.

#### 4. Setup Environment Variables

To connect to the database, you will need to provide a `DATABASE_URL` that is served from a local `.env` file.

In the root of the repository, run `touch .env`, and append the below content.

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[dbname]?schema=public"
```

Replace the placeholders with your local database information, and it should look something like this.

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:x5dws169!@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
```

#### 5. Setup Database

Once you have created your `.env` file, you should now be able to connect to the database and migrate it. To bring your local database up to the most recent schema, perform any migrations:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

#### 6. Launch Prisma CLI for Verification

You can verify that the database got populated properly by running:

```
npx prisma studio
```

This will run a local server (http://localhost:5555/) that you can access in browser to interact with your database.

#### 8. Complete

The project should be ready to run. To start the Next.js server, type:

```
npm run dev
```

You can now connect to the application at: http://localhost:3000/
